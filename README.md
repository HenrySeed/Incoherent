# Incoherent

A clone of the board game Articulate. Simplified and sped-up for fast-paced tongue twisting fun! As the timer counts down, the screen changes from grey to a slightly lighter grey.

Designed to be multiplayer, with each team using one phone, we rely on trust for who wins first.

You can customise how long each round is, and how many points you need to win.
